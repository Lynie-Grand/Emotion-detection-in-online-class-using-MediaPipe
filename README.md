# Emotion-detection-in-online-class-using-MediaPipe
A daily study in the area of human emotion identification has been vital in bringing about some
advances in online marketing, education, and other fields. The current paper attempts to provide
insights into students' perception abilities and responses in online classes by examining the
students' facial expressions, keeping the shift to online learning in mind. The classification of the
known facial landmark detection approaches is represented. The most promising approaches are
selected for the experimental comparison. These approaches are grounded on cascaded
regression and deep learning. The known open-source software executions for them are chosen,

viz. the MediaPipe framework. The trials are carried out on our dataset. To estimate and compare
the obtained results for the two tested approaches the source image is contrived manually.
Average diversions of the detected landmarks from the source are estimated. The comparison
shows that a little better precision and effectiveness of facial landmark detection is achieved
using the deep learning-based approach.A daily study in the area of human emotion
